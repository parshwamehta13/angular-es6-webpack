# angularjs-es6-webpack

A complete, yet simple, starter for writing AngularJS in ES-6 using Webpack.
It contains a collection of directives which would be easily injectible in any legacy(v1.x) AngularJS codebase (YES WE EXIST !!!).

### Quick start

```bash
# clone our repo
$ git clone https://github.com/preboot/angularjs-webpack.git angular-es6

# change directory to your app
$ cd angular-es6

# install the dependencies with npm
$ npm install

# start the server
$ npm start server
```

go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
